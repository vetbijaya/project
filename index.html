        <h3>MYCIN - An Early Expert System</h3>
        <p> My proposal topic is <strong>How Mycin can be used to identify the bacteria and recommend the antibiotics</strong>. Mycin was one of the initial expert systems in which an artificial intelligent (AI) program designed to provide expert level solutions to complex problems, understandable and flexible enough easily to accommodate new knowledge. Mycin was developed over five or six years in the early 1970s at Stanford University by Shortcliffe which assist in diagnosis and treatment of infectious diseases such as meningitis and bacterial septicemia. The Mycin system was also used for the diagnosis of blood clotting diseases. Mycin was written in Lisp programming language as the doctoral dissertation of Edward Shortcliffe under the direction of Bruce G. Buchanan, Stanley N. Cohen and others. There are two main parts to an expert system such as Mycin i) a knowledge base and ii) an inference engine/mechanism.</p>

        <h3>Background</h3>
        <p> Before Mycin, there was no existence of the expert system and this expert system was used to assist in diagnosis and treatment of infectious diseases such as meningitis and bacterial septicemia. The job of Mycin was to diagnose and recommend treatment for certain blood infections.Mycin was developed over five or six years in the early 1970s at Stanford by Shortcliffe.  Mycin operated using simple inference engine and a knowledge-base of approximately 600 rules. The Mycin system would query the physician running the program via a long series of simple yes/no questions. Finally, it provided a list of possible culprit bacteria ranked from high to low based on the probability of each diagnosis. Its confidence in each diagnosis probability and the reasoning behind each diagnosis and recommended course of drug treatment. Mycin assist internists in diagnosis and treatment of infectious diseases such as meningitis and bacterial septicemia. When patient shows signs of infectious disease then culture of blood and urine set to lab for 24 hours to determine the species of bacteria. Mycin provides the interim indication of organisms that are most likely cause of infection and drugs to control disease from the given patient data which are incomplete and inaccurate. From this interaction of drugs and already prescribed drugs taken into account and able to provide explanation of diagnosis.</p>
        <h3>Solution</h3>
        <p> Mycin primarily used backward chaining or goal-directed control strategy. In goal directed reasoning, a system starts with a statement of the goal to achieve and works backward through inference rules which is from right to left to find the data that establish that goal. The rule interpreter attempt to establish values of clinical parameters at the leaf nodes. The interpreter retrieves a list of rules and conclusions based on current goals and tries to evaluate these rules. Questions are asked only when the rules fail to conclude the necessary information and the rule is ignored if the user cannot supply the information.
            Mycin was implemented in the early 1970s and perhaps the most recognized and cited expert system. It performs bacteriological diagnosis both disease identification and treatment. It was tested against doctors, interns, medical teachers and medical students. In all of the experiment of some 80 different cases, it had actually outperformed them.
            Mycin was never actually used in practice. This was not because of any weakness in its performance but due to its tests it outperformed members of the Stanford medical school. It was as much due to the ethical and legal issues that is associated with the use of computers in medicine. If the computers gave you the wrong diagnoses, whom do you sue?

        <h3>Proposal Schedule/Plan</h3>
        <p> Mycin was never used actually in practice. This was not because of any weakness in its performance but some observers raised ethical and legal issues related to the use of computers in medicine. Although the greatest problem and reason that Mycin was not used in practice was the state of technologies for system integration especially at the time it was developed. At that time Mycin was a stand-alone system which required a user to enter all relevant information about the patient by typing responses to questions that was posed by Mycin. The program ran on a large time-shared system available over the early Internet which is ARPANet that is before personal computers were developed.
            Mycin combines the advantages of general rule-based system with the advantages of an inexact reasoning system. Mycin has not addresses how to convert from human terms to certainties; how to normalize across different people; based on new evidence, how far to propagate certainty factor changes; how to provide feedback to database to improve accuracy of certainty factor.

        <h3>Conclusion</h3>
        <p> Mycin was one of the earliest expert systems and its design has strongly influenced the design of commercial expert systems and shells of expert system. Mycin was developed over five or six years in the early 1970s at Stanford University by Shortcliffe which assist in diagnosis and treatment of infectious diseases such as meningitis and bacterial septicemia. Mycin was written in Lisp programming language as the doctoral dissertation of Edward Shortcliffe under the direction of Bruce G. Buchanan, Stanley N. Cohen and others. Mycin was an early backward chaining expert system which used artificial intelligence to identify bacteria causing severe infections and recommend antibiotics with the dosage adjusted for patient body weight. The name of antibiotics derived from the antibiotics themselves as many antibiotics have the suffix -mycin. The greatest influence of Mycin was its demonstration of the power of its representation and reasoning approach. In many non-medical domains, rule-based systems were developed which is followed by Mycin introduction of the approach. In the 1980s, expert system shells were introduced which include one based on Mycin known as E-MYCIN which is followed by Knowledge Engineering Environment (KEE) which supported the development of expert systems in a wide variety of application areas.
